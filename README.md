Class diagram exist in the classDiagram.pdf in the top-level directory.
Tests exist in the Tests.pdf in the top-level directory.
app exists in the top-level directory as Final.apk.


Architecture:
The app is made using android studio.
The code is split into 2 main sections, the java files and th xml files.
The xml files are the layouts of activities while the java files host the code that the app is made of.
The UI is app-based and inputs are done by entering text in the app.

Future Work For Devs:

Future developers can implement the Gson library made by google, this will allow for custom variable to be send to other activites via shared preferences.
This will allow for less variables to be based between activites making the code cleaner as the user can use the patient, test, contactdetails etc. java files to create custom variables. The framework for this has already been started in the MainNurse.java file, future devs can work on this.

Future devs can also implement databases to store information so info can be sent to a network of devices and info can be stored in the cloud.

Devs can also make a booking feature for guests to the app to book an appointment for a covid-19 test.
